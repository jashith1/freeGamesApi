free games api + a pretty faulty google oauth yt playlist downloader implementation, use <a href='https://github.com/jashith1/playlistDownloader'>this</a> python implementation instead. <br>
hosted <a href='https://pipapi.onrender.com/freeGames'>here</a> <br>
Note: you'll need to pass in "lastGame" as a query which needs ot be the title of a free game on the freeGamesRss list. It'll then return the free games released since then. This is auto handled in <a href="https://github.com/jashith1/firefoxPip">firefox pip</a> (see backgound/freeGames.js).
